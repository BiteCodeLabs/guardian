# Guardian Bot

Guardian is a discord bot made specifically for minecraft servers. I am constantly making upgrades and adding features to it so suggestions are most welcome. Guardian is still under construction and in its current state it is a proof of concept. There will be breaking changes soon and I intend on refactoring the code base using industry best practices.




## Features

- Auto Whitelisting / Unwhitelisting using the Pterodactyl Panel API
- Inactivity checks
- Applications / Interviews

## Planned Features

- Auto Reddit recruitting
- Infomation commands
## Deployment

```bash
  # Building the bot

  npm run build
```

Copy and rename the example config file to config.yml and then add it to a directory called config


```bash
  # To start the bot run 

  npm run start
```
