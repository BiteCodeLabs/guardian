# Guardian Bot

Guardian is a discord bot that was specifically made for Minecraft servers. I am always making upgrades and adding features to it, so suggestions are welcome. Guardian is still a work in progress and, at this time, is only a proof of concept. There will be some breaking changes in the near future, and I plan on refactoring the code using industry best practices.




## Features

- Auto Whitelisting / Unwhitelisting using the Pterodactyl Panel API
- Inactivity checks
- Applications / Interviews

## Planned Features

- Auto Reddit recruitting
- Infomation commands
## Deployment

```bash
  # Building the bot

  npm run build
```

Copy and rename the example config file to config.yml and then add it to a directory called config


```bash
  # To start the bot run 

  npm run start
```
